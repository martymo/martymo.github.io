I find that my children are more receptive to the concept of infinity than infinitesimals.

They readily accept that infinity is larger than any big number (my 7 years old often uses zillion or xillons he makes up) you can think of, which can be demonstrated by simply adding 1 to the number. And after discussing they also accept that infinity is not a number. although they have probably not understood  abstract “concept”, they accept that you cannot present infinity in any other way than accepting that it is larger than any number.

And then I talked to them the arrow paradox from the Zeno of Elea to introduce infinitesimals. Here is the arrow paradox as I remember. Suppose an arrow goes a straight line and hits the target. Image we mark the point whenever the arrow reaches half of the distance left between itself and the target. When the arrow hits the target, the distance is zero and we shall stop the marking process. However, we continue to mark the points, the arrow I’ll never reach the target. This contradicts the reality!

First of all, children are likely to equate the number of marking points to the time it takes the arrow to hit the target. We really are really saying that while the number of half way stop points increases, the remaining distance decreases.

The important notion is that as long as the marking process continues, which we can, the arrow never reaches the target. However small the remaining distance is, it can still be halved, the halved distance will be smaller. But it is not zero. That is infinitesimal. Similar to infinity, it is not known figure either. As soon as you say it, you can find something ever smaller, but not zero. This is a harder concept to grasp than infinity for two reasons.

First, although infinity is not discrete, we are so used to natural numbers and especially children will think of adding one to find the big number and hence we tend to use discreet thinking to grasp the idea. On the other hand, infinitesimal is inherently continuous, it is smaller than one but bigger than zero. Children who are not fluent in decimal numbers tend to make more jumps to grasp it. Also infinity does not converge. It keeps going up. That brings up our second reason.

Second, the limit of infinitesimal is zero when the counting goes to infinity. There is so sort of coexistence of something bigger than anything else and something smaller than anything else and they dissolve together at the same time. For example, the arrow reaches the target in other words the infinitesimal distance disappears and zero, which children tend to understand well, appears, when the number of marking points goes to infinity. I think it is another huge leap from infinitesimal to limits in thinking.

I think here are some words that may draw some interest from children about these concepts:

- Infinity is purely big because nothing is bigger
- Infinitesimal is purely small because nothing is smaller
- Infinity goes up for ever
- Infinitesimal disappears to zero if something else goes up infinitely
- nothing ever reaches infinity and nothing ever reaches infinitesimal
